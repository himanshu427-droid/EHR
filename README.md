## üë• User Roles

The system supports **6 distinct user roles**, each with specific permissions:

1. **Patient** ‚Äî View and share health records, manage consent  
2. **Doctor** ‚Äî Create prescriptions, view patient records (with consent)  
3. **Lab/Diagnostics** ‚Äî Upload lab reports  
4. **Hospital Admin** ‚Äî Manage users, verify blockchain data integrity  
5. **Insurance Company** ‚Äî Review and approve claims  
6. **Researcher** ‚Äî Access anonymized medical datasets

## üì¶ Prerequisites

### For Replit Development
- Node.js 20+
- npm or yarn

### For Local Deployment with Hyperledger Fabric
- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose 2.0+
- Node.js 20+
- Git
- Hyperledger Fabric `fabric-samples` repository

## üöÄ Quick Start (Replit - Development Mode)

The app is configured to run on **Replit** without Docker using:
- In-memory storage instead of MongoDB  
- Blockchain simulation instead of Fabric  

This allows full testing without infrastructure setup ‚Äî all blockchain operations are simulated but mimic Fabric behavior.

**Steps:**
1. Run `npm run dev`  
2. Access the app at your Replit URL  
3. Register a new account with any role  
4. Login and explore the dashboard  
5. All features work, including simulated blockchain verification  

> **Note:** For production deployment with real Hyperledger Fabric, see below.

## üê≥ Local Deployment with Docker (Without Fabric)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <your-repo-url>
cd medichain-ehr

# Create .env file
cp .env.example .env

# Generate JWT secret
openssl rand -base64 32
# Add this to .env:
# JWT_SECRET=<your-secret>

# Build and run services
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker-compose down
